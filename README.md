# Git and GitHub
  It was an explosive start to front-end learning! At first it was hard for me because of English)) but with each lesson it became easier and easier to learn. I really liked the Git tool, and I will definitely use it in my studies, work and my projects. Many thanks to Kottans for the great course. I'm moving on to the next Linux, Command Line, HTTP tools!)

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

  I took a closer look at Linux command line basics. And although I use Windows, I will definitely switch to Linux in the near future.

  I really liked working with the command line and I was surprised how easy it is to interact with the file system and the computer as a whole.

  I also read articles about HTTP, but since I had previously studied the development of server applications, I was already familiar with this protocol.

## Git Collaboration

  This part was definitely difficult for me. Still, I understood the basic principle of interaction through the github. I liked the rebase command, but here it is the most incomprehensible to me.

  In conclusion, I can say that it was very interesting, and I will definitely use and develop my skills in working with git and github.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

  I already knew HTML and CSS before, so most of the things didn't surprise me, except that the Udacity course seemed incredibly boring :) But I still stumbled upon one novelty, this is the basics of the grid on codecademy, I really look forward to full support for this cool technology by all browsers!

## Responsive Web Design

  There were a lot of interesting things about responsive website design. It was especially interesting to know that there is a difference between device pixels and CSS pixels. But I especially found the advice on button and link sizes for mobile devices helpful. As well as text size, font and line height.

## JS Basics

  I've done!!! It took a long time. I discovered an interesting resource, freeCodeCump. There I was especially interested in studying the ES6 standard with its new features. Now, finally, I'm moving on to the next task!

## DOM
![task_js_basics](https://github.com/webdevtoday/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_js_dom/screenshot-classroom.udacity.com-2020.11.21-11_22_52.png)

  At this point, I noticed that Udacity with Richard is always very interesting and educational. He gave very interesting material about the methods of manipulating the page, as well as the mechanics of the browser of processing pages in general. It was especially interesting to learn about methods to optimize the DOM intervention process.

  I did the tasks on freeCodeCamp in the previous task, so all my impressions about it are there.

  I really liked the practical part of the task. I got carried away with the implementation of the technical part, but I wasn't at all interested in the appearance of the page. So in the end I was already in a hurry to finish the rest of the site. But I definitely want to dig a little more precisely in the technical implementation of my site)

## Object Oriented JS

  [Demo](https://webdevtoday.github.io/frogger-game/index.html) | Demo of the game

  There are a lot of interesting things about prototypes and scopes in this part of the course. I also found out that not only Richard can be very interesting on Udacity))

  But most of all I was improved by the work on the practical task Frogger Game and the very useful comments and tips from Oleksey Rudenko. Going through this task, I realized that you do not need to skimp on variables, and also touched a little on the topic of thinking through the program in advance, making each of its parts as extensible as possible.
