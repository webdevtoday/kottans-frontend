# Git and GitHub
  It was an explosive start to front-end learning! At first it was hard for me because of English)) but with each lesson it became easier and easier to learn. I really liked the Git tool, and I will definitely use it in my studies, work and my projects. Many thanks to Kottans for the great course. I'm moving on to the next Linux, Command Line, HTTP tools!)

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

  I took a closer look at Linux command line basics. And although I use Windows, I will definitely switch to Linux in the near future.

  I really liked working with the command line and I was surprised how easy it is to interact with the file system and the computer as a whole.

  I also read articles about HTTP, but since I had previously studied the development of server applications, I was already familiar with this protocol.

## Git Collaboration

  This part was definitely difficult for me. Still, I understood the basic principle of interaction through the github. I liked the rebase command, but here it is the most incomprehensible to me.

  In conclusion, I can say that it was very interesting, and I will definitely use and develop my skills in working with git and github.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

  I already knew HTML and CSS before, so most of the things didn't surprise me, except that the Udacity course seemed incredibly boring :) But I still stumbled upon one novelty, this is the basics of the grid on codecademy, I really look forward to full support for this cool technology by all browsers!

## Responsive Web Design

  There were a lot of interesting things about responsive website design. It was especially interesting to know that there is a difference between device pixels and CSS pixels. But I especially found the advice on button and link sizes for mobile devices helpful. As well as text size, font and line height.
